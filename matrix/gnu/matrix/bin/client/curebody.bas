Note that if (V, ◦) and (W, ◦) are vector spaces of the same order and U is
some set formed by an operation on V and W , then (U, ◦) may not be a vector
space because it is not closed under the axpy operation, ◦. We sometimes refer
to a set of vectors of the same order together with the axpy operator (whether
or not the set is closed with respect to the operator) as a “space of vectors”
(instead of a “vector space”).
