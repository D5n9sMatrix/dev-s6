2.1.2.7 Set Operations on Vector Spaces
The ordinary operations of subsetting, intersection, union, direct sum, and
direct product for sets have analogs for vector spaces, and we use some of the
same notation to refer to vector spaces that we use to refer to sets. The set
operations themselves are performed on the individual sets to yield a set of
vectors, and the resulting vector space is the space generated by that set of
vectors.
